Input: 2/3+1/4, Prediction: 11/12
Response from GPT: Sure, let's think through this step-by-step:

1. The correct way to solve 2/3 + 1/4 is to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 3 and 4 is 12. 

   - Convert 2/3 to a fraction with a denominator of 12: 
     \( \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 \times 4}{3 \times 4} = \frac{8}{12} \)
   - Convert 1/4 to a fraction with a denominator of 12: 
     \( \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1 \times 3}{4 \times 3} = \frac{3}{12} \)
   - Add the fractions: 
     \( \frac{8}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{8 + 3}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \)

2. The student's prediction of 11/12 is correct.

3. RESPONSE_TO_STUDENT: That's correct. 2/3 + 1/4 = 11/12.

Now, let's move on to a new example.
Next example reasoning: Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. The student correctly solved the addition problem, so they likely understand how to add fractions. However, based on the initial description, the student might have a misconception about multiplying fractions, especially if they tend to incorrectly multiply only the numerators when the denominators are equal.

2. To address this misconception, a multiplication example would be most effective.

3. A specific fraction problem that would be informative is one where the denominators are equal, to see if the student multiplies only the numerators.

NEXT_EXAMPLE: 2/5 * 3/5
Next example: 2/5 * 3/5
Constructed GPT message: That's correct. 2/3+1/4=11/12. What is 2/5 * 3/5?
Observation: Input: 2/3+1/4, Output: 11/12, Prediction: 11/12
