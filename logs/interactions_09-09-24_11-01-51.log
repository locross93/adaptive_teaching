Input: 1/4+2/4, Prediction: 3/4
Response from GPT: Alright, let's think through this step-by-step:

1. To solve 1/4 + 2/4, we need to add the numerators since the denominators are the same. So, 1 + 2 = 3. The denominator remains 4. Therefore, 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4.
2. If the student's prediction is 3/4, it is correct.

Now, let's provide a direct response to the student:

RESPONSE_TO_STUDENT: That's correct. 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4.

Let's try another problem:

What is 1/3 * 2/3?
Next example reasoning: Let's think through these steps:

1. The student seems to understand addition correctly, as they correctly solved 1/4 + 2/4. However, we haven't yet tested their understanding of multiplication thoroughly.
2. To address potential misconceptions about multiplication (such as only multiplying numerators or making common denominators before multiplying), a multiplication example would be best.
3. A specific fraction problem that involves different denominators might be most informative to clarify this misconception.

NEXT_EXAMPLE: 2/3 * 3/4
Next example: 2/3 * 3/4
Constructed GPT message: That's correct. 1/4+2/4=3/4. What is 2/3 * 3/4?
Observation: Input: 1/4+2/4, Output: 3/4, Prediction: 3/4
