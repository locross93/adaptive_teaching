Input: 3/4*2/4, Prediction: 6/4
Response from GPT: 1. The correct way to solve 3/4 * 2/4 is to multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
   - Numerators: 3 * 2 = 6
   - Denominators: 4 * 4 = 16
   - So, 3/4 * 2/4 = 6/16

2. The student's prediction of 6/4 is incorrect because they only multiplied the numerators and did not multiply the denominators correctly.

3. RESPONSE_TO_STUDENT: That's incorrect. 3/4 * 2/4 = 6/16.

What is 1/3 + 2/5?
Next example reasoning: 1. The student seems to have a misconception about multiplying fractions, specifically only multiplying the numerators and not the denominators.

2. A multiplication example would best address this misconception.

3. A specific fraction problem that would be informative is one where the denominators are different, to see if the student tries to make common denominators before multiplying.

NEXT_EXAMPLE: What is 2/3 * 3/5?
Observation: Input: 3/4*2/4, Output: 6/16, Prediction: 6/4

Input: 2/3*3/5, Prediction: 6/15
Response from GPT: 1. The correct way to solve 2/3 * 3/5 is to multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
   - Numerators: 2 * 3 = 6
   - Denominators: 3 * 5 = 15
   - So, 2/3 * 3/5 = 6/15

2. The student's prediction of 6/15 is correct.

3. RESPONSE_TO_STUDENT: That's correct. 2/3 * 3/5 = 6/15.

What is 1/4 + 3/8?
Next example reasoning: 1. The student seems to have a misconception about multiplying fractions, specifically only multiplying the numerators and not the denominators.

2. A multiplication example would best address this misconception.

3. A specific fraction problem that would be informative is one where the denominators are the same, to see if the student still only multiplies the numerators.

NEXT_EXAMPLE: What is 4/7 * 3/7?
Observation: Input: 2/3*3/5, Output: 6/15, Prediction: 6/15
