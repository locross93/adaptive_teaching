Input: 3/4+2/5, Prediction: 23/20
Response from GPT: 1. To solve 3/4 + 2/5, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 4 and 5 is 20. 

   - Convert 3/4 to a fraction with a denominator of 20: 
     \( \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3 \times 5}{4 \times 5} = \frac{15}{20} \)
   - Convert 2/5 to a fraction with a denominator of 20: 
     \( \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2 \times 4}{5 \times 4} = \frac{8}{20} \)

   - Add the fractions: 
     \( \frac{15}{20} + \frac{8}{20} = \frac{15 + 8}{20} = \frac{23}{20} \)

2. The student's prediction of 23/20 is correct.

3. RESPONSE_TO_STUDENT: That's correct. 3/4 + 2/5 = 23/20.

What is 3/4 * 2/5?
Next example reasoning: 1. The student correctly solved the addition problem, so they understand how to add fractions. However, they might have misconceptions about multiplying fractions, particularly if they tend to only multiply the numerators or make common denominators before multiplying.

2. A multiplication example would best address this misconception.

3. A specific fraction problem that would be informative is one where the denominators are different, to see if the student tries to make common denominators before multiplying.
