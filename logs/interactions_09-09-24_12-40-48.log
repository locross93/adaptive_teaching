Input: 3/4*2/4, Prediction: 6/4
Response from GPT: 1. The correct way to solve 3/4 * 2/4 is to multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
   - Numerator: 3 * 2 = 6
   - Denominator: 4 * 4 = 16
   So, 3/4 * 2/4 = 6/16.

2. The student's prediction of 6/4 is incorrect because they only multiplied the numerators and did not multiply the denominators correctly.

3. RESPONSE_TO_STUDENT: That's incorrect. 3/4 * 2/4 = 6/16.
